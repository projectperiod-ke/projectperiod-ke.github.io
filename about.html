                <p>In 2023 alone,
                    250,000 girls aged
                    10-19 experienced

            <h1 class="conth1">What is ‘Project Period!’ </h1>
            <p class="contP"> Project Period! is a community-based program
                created to support girls aged 12 and above in rural
                Kenya as they go through puberty. We provide a safe
                and welcoming space for girls to learn, ask questions,
                and share their own experiences. We currently have
                23 members but we have plans on the way to expand
                across the county.</p>

            <h1 class="conth1">Our Mission </h1>
            <p class="contP"> We hope to empower girls to make informed decisions
                about their reproductive health and overall well
                being. We aim to break the stigma surrounding
                puberty through conversation and education. Our goal
                is to create a safe community where girls can learn,
                grow, and realize their potential, knowing they are
                capable of succeeding.</p>

            <h1 class="conth1"> Our Story</h1>
            <p class="contP"> In early 2023, Louisa, the founder of Project Period,
                was deeply moved by the story of yet another girl from
                the local primary school dropping out due to teenage
                pregnancy. Louisa felt the need to take action,
                knowing the system and community had failed these
                girls in so many ways already. They started Project Period! at their
                local school with the goal of educating
                young girls about their bodies, safety, and how to
                navigate through such an important time in their lives. She also teaches
                classes on important but often ignored topics such as
                consent.</p>

            <h1 class="conth1">What Do The Sessions Look Like? </h1>
            <p class="contP">Each session starts off with reflections on the past
                month and setting goals for the new month. To
                incentivise people to pursue their goals, we do prizes
                for all the people who achieve their monthly goals.
                We then have the main session which takes place as a
                discussion of the new content. We do discussions as
                they make it easy to ask questions at any moment. We
                finish off with smaller group discussions, individual
                reflections and questions.</p>
